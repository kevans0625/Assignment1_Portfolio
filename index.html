            <p>Hi, my name is Kristin. I am a digital marketer studying to become a full stack web developer.
                I am based in the metro Houston area. I am enjoying learning about front end development and
                I am exted about learning about back end development.</p>
            <p>My hopes is to combine my coding skills with my online marketing skills. This knowledge will equip me
                with the ability to bundle my service and offer more value to
                potential employers or clients. Having these type of skills in one place is more strategic and
                ultimatley provides better success for branding purposes.
